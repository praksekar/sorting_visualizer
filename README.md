# React Sorting Visualizer

Sorting visualizer that visually demonstrates how merge, insertion, and bubble sort work. GUI includes slider for adjusting sort speed, a pause/play button, and buttons for choosing sort type. I made this project because I wanted a practice project to learn React and was a good review on sorting algorithms.

Built using react.js and react-bootstrap components.
